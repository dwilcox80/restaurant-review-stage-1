# Restaurant Review Project Stage 1 - Front End Nanodegree
---

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project, we were asked to convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In the first phase, we needed to add responsive design principles as well as add A11y principles for screen reader users.  We were given the choice of adding the MapBox API or Google Maps API. The last task was to add a Service Worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience.

### Materials Provided

We were provided the code for the restaurant reviews website as well as the restaurant details page. A database was provided to add details for the restaurants such as geolocation, hours, restaurant names, etc.  Please see the **CODEOWNERS** file for the authors of these files.

### To View the Website

1.  Download this repository to your local machine.

2. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

3. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

4. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.

5. Explore the website and have fun!
